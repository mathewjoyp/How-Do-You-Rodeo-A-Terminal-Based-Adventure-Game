# How-Do-You-Rodeo-A-Terminal-Based-Adventure-Game
We have created a terminal based adventure game which has multiple games ingrained into it.
The game takes different paths depending on user input and joins at multiple junction points. It has a branching storyline with endings good, bad and ugly.
We used multiple python libraries such as time, os, sys, msvcrt, random and their built-in functions.
Run main.py in terminal to play the game with all the other files in the same repository.
