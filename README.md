# How-Do-You-Rodeo-A-Terminal-Based-Adventure-Game
We have created a terminal based adventure game which has multiple games engraved into it.
The game takes different paths depending on user input and joins at multiple junction points. It has an "engaging" storyline with multiple endings both bad and good.
We used multiple python libraries such as time, os, sys, msvcrt, random and their built-in functions.
